Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py


if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")
