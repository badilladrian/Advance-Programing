username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)


Add a placeholder where you want to display the price:
price = 49
txt = "The price is {} dollars"
print(txt.format(price))

And add more placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item number {} for {:.2f} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

Also, if you want to refer to the same value more than once, use the index number:
age = 36
name = "John"
txt = "His name is {1}. {1} is {0} years old."
print(txt.format(age, name))


You can also use named indexes by entering a name inside the curly brackets {carname},
but then you must use names when you pass the parameter values txt.format(carname = "Ford"):

myorder = "I have a {carname}, it is a {model}."
print(myorder.format(carname = "Ford", model = "Mustang"))
